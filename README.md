Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Iris Dataset
________________________________________
🎯 Task Objective:
The main purpose of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. This means exploring the data visually and statistically to understand its structure and relationships before applying any machine learning models.
We aimed to:
✅ Understand feature distributions
✅ Explore how different iris species differ in measurements
✅ Visualize relationships between features
✅ Detect any outliers or issues in the dataset
This step is important because it gives a strong foundation for future tasks like classification or model building.

📊 Dataset Used:
•	 Dataset Name: Iris
•	 Source: Built-in dataset from the Seaborn library
•	 Total Records: 150 rows, 5 columns
•	 Features:
o	sepal_length (cm)
o	sepal_width (cm)
o	petal_length (cm)
o	petal_width (cm)
•	🏷️ Target Column: species – Includes 3 flower types:
o	Setosa
o	Versicolor
o	 Virginica
This is a classic dataset in machine learning and data science, often used for beginner classification problems and visualization practice.

🛠️ Steps Performed :
Since this task was purely focused on EDA, I didn’t apply any machine learning algorithms. Instead, I worked with data exploration tools and visualization libraries. Here’s what I did:
1.	 Loaded the dataset using sns.load_dataset('iris').
2.	 Viewed first few rows with df.head() to check the structure.
3.	 Checked shape with df.shape – confirmed 150 rows × 5 columns.
4.	 info() to look at data types and non-null counts.
5.	 Used describe() to get basic statistical info (mean, std, min, max, etc.).
6.	 Visualized data using:
🔁 Pair Plot – compared all features across species.
📦 Box Plot – to see spread and possible outliers in features.
📈 Histogram / Distplots – to check distributions.
🌡️ Correlation Heatmap – to find relationships between features.

✅ Key Results and Findings:
•	No missing data – the dataset is clean and ready for use.
•	Petal features (length & width) are most helpful in distinguishing species.
•	 Setosa is clearly separable from other species just using petal measurements.
•	 Versicolor and Virginica have some overlap but still show trends.
•	 Correlation heatmap shows:
🔗 Strong correlation between petal_length and petal_width.
🔗 Weak correlation between sepal_width and other features.
•	Box plots helped identify:
o	Spread of features across each species.
o	Slight outliers in sepal_width.


🧠 Final Thoughts:
This EDA task helped me understand the structure and behavior of the Iris dataset. 
The visualizations made it easy to see which features will be useful for classification.
It's a crucial step that sets the stage for the next tasks involving modeling and predictions.

The end....
